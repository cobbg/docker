This image has been deprecated and is not being updated going forward.

We encourage you to use non-containerized DB or an existing image such as the image provided at https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/postgresql rather than building your own image.  You can reference an example of how to configure the bitnami/postgresql image here:  https://github.com/dotCMS/docker/blob/master/referenceImplementations/01-demo/docker-compose.yml

Building custom images may create more complexity and challenges as it relates to the ongoing support of your installation.  Please contact support@dotcms.com to inquire about add-on product services available for extended support around Docker.  

If you feel you must create your own custom docker image(s), please contact dotCMS Support to discuss product compatibility and scope-of-support concerns prior to implementation.
